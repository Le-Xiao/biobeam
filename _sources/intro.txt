Introduction
=============


*biobeam* is an open software platform to rigorously simulate the image-formation process of fluorescent light microscopes, especially deep inside scattering biological tissues.

For this *biobeam* integrates highly parallelized graphics processor units into a flexible computational pipe-lines starting with laser illumination of a specimen, and ending with a partially coherent images, videos and 3d datasets, as recorded by a fluorescence camera.

Aberrations
===========

Given a refractive index model, biobeam is able to calculate sample induced aberrations by probing diffraction limited point sources at arbitrary points of the sample. These aberrations patterns can be decomposed into Zernike modes, and spatially mapped accross the sample.

    An aberration pre-compensated focus is generated inside a highly scattering tissue.


Exploiting the time-reversal symmetry of light propagation, it is further possible to pre-compensated aberrations on the way of light into the sample. These simulations enable to systematically study the determinants of sample-induced aberrations, and improving adaptive optics imaging strategies.
